For In PrusaSlicer's Notes (you have to change it to "Normal Mode"), change it to this:

```
Don't remove the following keywords! These keywords are used in the "compatible printer" condition of the print and filament profiles to link the particular print and filament profiles to this printer profile.
PRINTER_VENDOR_CREALITY
PRINTER_MODEL_ENDER3V2
VOLCANO
```


Speed Settings (You can push these if you want, it gets a little wonky if you push acceleration above 6000)
