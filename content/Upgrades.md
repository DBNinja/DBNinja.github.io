These are the upgrades on my Ender 3 V2 and what they do. If you haven't seen the [[Getting Started Guide]] I recommend starting there.



## **Purchased Upgrades**

[BLTouch](https://www.amazon.com/ANTCLABS-BLTouch-Leveling-Premium-Extension/dp/B076PQG1FF?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.enNlsF4bS0PfK42BMAZEHKEKb2uNaBNlj8WaMTmZfLu6n4FKrjMpCP6Nkapc4vsCiyVwOJdz2XXwRXP852mCvwZXvgbRC4Wx3vm_9N3V2IzRnX9r04bWNsZLVaKg0EEncv-j2pQoB0D7I_qBxMh-FXB5AFiYOBb7lafbEOmK14_t7tirf9J5E4IiDYa1gV7CZhpQ4ipZZS-ChjGnfR2Ocsku51PoZFHbAK9r4Mg4cEE.-nPhW5NK-HrRtHtER9hWweZs2qD6SeJY35LVDrS4wYY&dib_tag=se&keywords=bltouch&qid=1740336082&sr=8-4)
- Allows for autoleveling of the bed

[Solid bed mounts](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MH4JQB8?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)
- Prevents issues with springs because we're using the BLTouch for leveling

Upgraded Z axis to [linear rails](https://dfh.fm/products/beltdrivenender3-linear-rails-kit-by-kevinakasam-black-steel?_pos=9&_sid=c612ebff4&_ss=r) and belt driven
- Better stability/drawing on Z axis

[Magnetic Bed ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CKXNQBVB?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1) and PEI sheet
- Easy to clean and remove prints
- Better adhesion

[Voxel Bento Box 2](https://voxelpla.com/products/bento-box?variant=44537975537882) with 4028 (high flow) fans (I could have manually printed this though)
- Filters out VOCs if you're using the enclosure

[Enclosure](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D78TGY1L?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1)
- Purchased so that I can print ABS/ASA (and any other materials that have fumes), and to keep smells in the container to alleviate Meiling's concerns

[ObXidian](https://www.matterhackers.com/store/l/e3d-obxidian-wear-resistant-nozzle?rcode=RECEIPT) wear resistant nozzle
- Less than 1kg worth of printing in PETG/PLA combined (I think it's just in PETG though)
- Should last almost forever assuming you don't use abrasive materials. Normally the nozzle is a wear item that you have to replace every so often when it gets worn out.

[Slice engineering upgrade kit](https://www.sliceengineering.com/products/ender-upgrade-bundle?variant=43337597354225)
- Better temp, speed, and printing stability (reduced chance of clogs)
- Allows higher temperature (300 degrees C) for additional materials support

[BMG Clone Extruder](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HL83GXN) 
- Allows for direct drive extrusion, allowing for faster printing and reduced need for retraction


## **Printed upgrades**

[KevenAKASam's Belt Driven Mod](https://kevinakasam.com/belt-driven-ender-3/) - 
Options chosen - [shortcut here](https://kevinakasam.com/snmd623-2/) -
	1. Single Z Setup
	2. Normal Hight
	3. Linear Rails
	4. Direct Drive Extruder
	5. F23 Bearings
	
- Improves Z axis stability and eliminates problems with Z screw



[Minime Remix](https://www.printables.com/model/233046-minime-remix-height-adjustable-4010-5015-part-cool)
- I think I used this version at least.
- Better cooling, re-printable. Was printed in PLA, need/want to reprint in PETG in case PLA doesn't hold.



[SpeedDrive](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4597441) (Remix to work with Ender3V2)
- Direct Drive Mod
- Why this one? It allows for the fastest printing speeds with minimum quality hit. Original SpeedDrive [documentation here](https://github.com/sashalex007/speedDrive)









## **Other tools I've purchased along the way**
### but don't consider part of the printer itself

[Raspberry Pi](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Model-2019-Quad-Bluetooth/dp/B07TD42S27)
- You can use this to install OctoPi and manage your printer remotely (print via wifi, attach a camera and watch it from around the house, monitor temps, etc.)
- If you get one, you can [print a case](https://www.printables.com/model/24942-raspberry-pi-34-b-case) (or you can buy a [kit that includes one](https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-4GB-Starter-Kit/dp/B07V5JTMV9))
- This can also be used to run Klipper if you end up going down the 3D printing rabbit hole

[USB Data Blocker](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B094FYL9QT?ref=nb_sb_ss_w_as-reorder_k0_1_8&amp=&crid=1K0ISGTJXQEOK&sprefix=usb%2Bdata&th=1)
- If you use the Raspberry Pi, this will help prevent the Pi from turning the printer on when you want the printer to be off

Some old cheap Logitech USB Webcam
- Lets you see the printer when attached to the Raspberry Pi. I have a cheap old Logitech webcam

[Sovol SH01 Filament Dryer](https://www.sovol3d.com/products/large-filament-dryer-box)
- Dries your filament because if it gets wet (via ambient humidity), it can print worse
- I have modded mine to set a default drying time of 72 hours
- My main problem with this is that it only goes up to 50C
