Here's my page about my Ender 3 V2.

I suggest going to the [[Getting Started Guide]]. 

For the full list of things I did to my printer, you can check out the [[Upgrades]].

### Other printers to look at:
[A1 Mini ](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/a1-mini) by Bambu Labs. Bambu's known for their "plug-and-play" capabilities. It also connects to an "AMS" which lets you print multiple colors (but that costs extra)

[Ender 3 V3 series](https://store.creality.com/collections/ender-series-3d-printer?spm=..product_fafd7f3c-344b-4298-b2dd-7e2a361430ad.breadcrumbs_1.1&spm_prev=..product_accf228c-979f-450e-90b4-4d88e008979f.nav_link_store_1.1) - Good bang for your buck. Supposedly less work and works really well out of the box (though I think I've done the hard part with my printer).

[Prusa Printers](https://www.prusa3d.com/category/3d-printers/) - More expensive, but are also known as workhorses
